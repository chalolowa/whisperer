This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This application allows users to upload audio files and receive accurate transcriptions using AI technology.

## Features
1. AI-Powered Transcription: Leverages advanced AI models to transcribe audio files accurately.
2. User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI built with Next.js.
3. File Upload: Easily upload audio files for transcription.
4. Real-Time Feedback: Get real-time updates on the transcription process.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
